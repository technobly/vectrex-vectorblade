Vectrex Vectorblade PCB by Brett Walach
===

[Malban's Vectorblade PCB design](http://vide.malban.de/vectorblade/building-vectorblade/vectorblade-build-the-hardware), optimized with single gate SMT IC's (AND & NOT), 8 color RGB LED, and some gorgeous artwork applied.  Looks great in black soldermask with ENIG (gold flash) finish!

Yes these fit in [Sean Kelly reproduction cartridge shells](http://www.vectrexmulti.com/order2.html#!/Vectrex-Empty-Cartridge-Shells/c/38886086/offset=0&sort=normal) perfectly!

Ordering PCB's
===

OSHPark is a good place to order with purple or the new "after dark" theme color scheme.  You can upload the KiCad `vextrex-vectorblade.kicad_pcb` there directly.  I would download this entire Github repo ZIP file first though instead of just trying to save the PCB file from your browser.

Another way to order PCB's is by using the included [gerbers](gerbers/vectrex-vectorblade-v1.0.zip) and uploading those with all of the necessary specs to companies like [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) or [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)

Don't forget to make your board finish at least ENIG (gold flash) with a 45 degree chamfered edge.
